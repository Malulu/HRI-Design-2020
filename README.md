#### Half-day workshop on Designerly HRI Knowledge. Held in conjunction with the 29th IEEE International Conference on Robot and Human Interactive Communication (RO-MAN 2020)
##### Naples, Italy, September 4, 2020.


This workshop, that brings together HRI and Design researchers, is dedicated to the investigation of designerly forms of knowledge in HRI. In particular, learning from the existing debate in the Design and HCI fields, we will discuss the concept of intermediate-level knowledge through the specific perspective of HRI studies. 

The ultimate goal is to the state of art of HRI knowledge, by bridging it with the design discipline. 
By exploring perspectives, approaches, methods, tools, techniques, and contributions that fall within the concept of intermediate-level knowledge we'll start a conversation on what HRI design epistemology is (i.e., the study of knowledge creation) and could be, and how to evaluate and legitimate knowledge produced through HRI design practices.
