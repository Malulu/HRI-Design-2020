### Half-day workshop on Designerly HRI Knowledge. Held in conjunction with the 29th IEEE International Conference on Robot and Human Interactive Communication (RO-MAN 2020)
##### Naples, Italy, September 4, 2020.


This workshop, that will bring together HRI and Design researchers, is dedicated to the investigation of designerly forms of knowledge in HRI. In particular, learning from the existing debate in the Design and HCI fields, we will discuss the concept of intermediate-level knowledge through the specific perspective of HRI studies. 

The ultimate goal is to extend the state of art of HRI knowledge, by bridging it with the design discipline. 
By exploring perspectives, approaches, methods, tools, techniques, and contributions that fall within the concept of intermediate-level knowledge, we'll start a conversation on what HRI design epistemology is (i.e., the study of knowledge creation) and could be, and how to evaluate and legitimate knowledge produced through HRI design practices.

### Call for designerly HRI contributions
Design contributions have been steadily growing in Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) studies. The majority of these, however, usually tend to produce insights and knowledge adapting to modalities typical of the HRI research community, such as introducing a (novel) robot platform and empirically evaluating it get a generalizable understanding of the interaction between humans and robots. Despite being relevant and necessary, this approach to knwoledge production often misses the opportunity to construct forms of knowledged belonging to an intermediated level, in between the concretness of robotic instances and the abstraction of theories. These include design methodologies, guidelines, heuristics, patterns, concepts, experiential qualities, and annotated portfolios. Although partial discussions about these forms of knowledge can already be found in the HRI, comprehensive investigations are still lacking.
This workshop, then, aims at creating a venue for discussing relevant forms of intermediate-level knowledge and understanding what might be their specific contribution in HRI.
To this end, we strongly encourage submissions from researchers that work at the intersection of Human-Robot Interaction studies and Design Research. 

_Topics include but are not limited to:_
- HRI and interaction design
- Design and prototyping of robotic artifacts
- Robot aesthetics
- Design methods, tools, techniques in HRI
- HRI heuristics
- Human-centered robotics
- Participatory practices in HRI
- Speculative and Critical Design in HRI


#### Submissions
Authors are invited to prepare a position paper (2-4 pages including references) using a IEEE [template](https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html), and submit via email at: _gianni@pino.com_

Participants’ contributions will be published on our website and on Arxiv. A joint publication may emerge as report of the workshop outcomes.
